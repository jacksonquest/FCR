Customer: Hi, I recently got a new broadband connection two days ago, and I'm facing an issue with the router.

Agent: Hello! I'm sorry to hear that. Could you please describe the issue you're experiencing?

Customer: Yeah, so the router is not turning on properly. There's a red light on it, and I'm not able to connect to the internet.

Agent: I see. Since when have you been noticing this issue?

Customer: It started today. Yesterday, it seemed to be working fine.

Agent: Alright. Just to confirm, you're seeing only the red light on the router?

Customer: Yes, there's no green or blue light like I expected.

Agent: Okay, just give me a moment.
