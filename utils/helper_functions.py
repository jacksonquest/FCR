    Based on the following customer service knowledge base entry, analyze the customer query and provide a structured response in a valid JSON format without any additional text or explanation.:

    Conversation: {context['conversation']}
    Troubleshooting/Resolution: {context['troubleshooting_resolution']}
    Remarks: {context['remarks']}
    Transferred To: {context['transferred_to']}

    Customer Query: {query}

    **Instructions:**

    1.  **Troubleshooting Steps:** Analyze the conversation and "Troubleshooting/Resolution" and "Remarks" sections to create a list of troubleshooting actions that can be suggested to the customer, with each line on a new line.
    2.  **Transfer Information:** Use the "Transferred To" section to identify the appropriate department for transfer, if necessary.
    3.  **JSON Output:** Format the response as a JSON object with the following structure:

        {{
          "troubleshooting_steps": "[List of troubleshooting steps, e.g., 1. blah blah, 2. blah blah blah]",
          "transfer_to": "[Department name, e.g., Technical Team]"
        }}

    **Example:**

    {{
      "troubleshooting_steps": "1. Restart your device. 2. Check your internet connection. 3. Reinstall the application.",
